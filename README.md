>Welcome to my place to learn what coding is about, what github is about. Things or two about markup. I'm close to fifty and its about time to move out of my comfort zone which revolwes around virtualization, SQL administration and technical support.

Todo list:

 - [ ] add my current learning project for C#
 - [ ] add my favorite and useful TSQL snipplets
 - [ ] make this readme something nice with markup
